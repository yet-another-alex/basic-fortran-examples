# basic-fortran-examples
Basic easy to understand Fortran examples with lots of comments.
There's tons of complex examples and documentation for Fortran, so I thought I'll make some easier ones available in the hops of being useful to someone.

### csvgen.f90

Example of how to generate large amounts of data and sort it into csv file formats. Includes generating random integer values, as well as checking if a file exists and deleting it.

### fibonacci.f90

Calulcating Fibonacci numbers. Stops when reaching infinity (depending on used data type). Uses user input to determine the amount of loops to calculate.

### fileio.f90

Generates random numbers (real) and prints them into a csv-file. Proceeds to read them again in reverse order of the columns.

### helloworld.f90

Most basic example.

### input.f90

Basic user input example. Asks for two numbers and proceeds to print some calculations.

### pi.f90

Calculation of PI. If the data type is small enough, it will always be 3. Very fun. It also takes a long time if the iterations are too many.

### random.f90

Basic example on how to generate random numbers in a way that is controlled by the code. In this case it's integer data type values.

### sorting.f90

Some sorting algorithms implemented in Fortran. Includes timing the execution. Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort.
